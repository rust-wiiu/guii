# guii

A simple and fast (enough) immediate mode GUI framework.

> [!CAUTION]
> Prototype state! Nothing is stable, everything can change at any time, no consistent versioning.

guii is heavily inspired [Dear Imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) and [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui). Please check them out for GUIs for other platforms.
